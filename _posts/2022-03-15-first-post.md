Obligatory first post!

I just rediscovered Github Pages, and I'm excited to start making some projects! The first project that I'm going to tackle is a character creator for the new ATLA/LOK RPG, Avatar Legnds. It has a lot of interesting mechanics and not a lot of math, so I'm hoping this won't be too big of an undertaking. I'll check back here soon!
